<p class="text-left">My name is Gabriel San Martín and I am a freelance translator who works from Japanese or English into European Spanish and specializes in video games. I have participated in projects such as Ni no Kuni II and several titles of the Pokémon franchise. I have enjoyed video games from an early age, when my father bought, I mean, gifted a Nintendo 64 to me for Christmas. In recent years, I have acquired experience in the different stages of the localization of games for consoles, PC and mobile devices, and have also dipped a toe in teaching that whole process. My work experience and my personal preferences have always been inclined towards role playing games, but both as a fan and a professional I make sure to broaden my horizons and learn about all sorts of genres regularly. That is one of the biggest privileges of this line of work.</p>
<p class="text-left">Besides my main languages, I use the rest of FIGS languages (when their texts are available) as a reference during projects to ensure a top quality translation. I studied French for six years in high school, one year of German as part of my undergrad studies plus a one-week-long course at Goethe-Institut, and I am learning Italian among other languages by myself (and by eavesdropping some of my neighbouring colleagues conversations when there was such a thing as an office/back when I worked in an office).</p>
<p class="text-left">I have been an avid reader all my life and, like most translation students, I longed to translate literature. If you work in editorial translation and would like to give me a chance to fulfill that dream, my Contact section is wide open. And so are my interests. I foster a curiosity towards an array of topics and media, so any translation or localization project that I am suitable for is very welcome. You can take a look at a brief summary of my experience or download the full PDF version of my résumé in the CV section above.</p>
<p class="text-left">If you are wondering why I talk about gender and LGBTQ+ issues, the reason is that I belong to a couple of those letters, I was a founding member of an association for LGBTQI+ rights, and gender has been a life-long personal dilemma, which I am constantly trying to solve. I even dedicated my masters dissertation to it. In my work, I always apply a questioning approach and stand up for equality. Lately, I have taught myself and others about accessibility and the ability of the localization team to support good practices in video games so that everyone can enjoy video games equally.</p>

<p class="text-align:right">I was born in Asturias, in Northwestern Spain, and I set out to explore the world as soon as I could. I studied in Catalonia, Ireland and Japan. I took several languages as mementos from each of them, and a masters degree in Audiovisual Translation to boot. I have lived in the United Kingdom, and I currently reside in Canada (EDT). I do not know what my future destination is.</p>

<p class="text-left">What an intriguing/insightful/a witty and freely asked question, my inquisitive visitor. Humanity has posited many a/multiple plausible answers to this puzzling conundrum. Instead of boring you out of existence with my family tree or existentialist theories, I will restrict myself to explaining why I occupy this tiny space in the interwebs.</p>
<p class="text-left">As you must have gathered thanks to your insightful/perceptive/ nature, I have come to this plane to impress you with my colourful prose so that you take me to your leader or, if/in case you are self-leadered/your own boss, to persuade you to request my services. In the Blog section, you can peek into my other corner of the internet, where I write and intend to educate on translation and video game localization.</p>
